# Gyrase_Topo-seq
Exploring gyrase cleavage sites across *E. coli W3110* genome

DNA-gyrase is a type II topoisomerase that introduces negative superhelicity into topologically closed DNA molecules. It operates with two DNA segments - so called G and T. 
During catalysis the enzyme introduces temporal double-stranded break into G-segment, transfers T-segment through it and religates the gap. 
5'-ends of the DNA break are stabilized by formation of an intermediate covalent complex between DNA and gyrase.
Topo-Seq is a ChIP-Seq-like approach that exploits formation of these intermediates to map the gyrase cleavage sites (GCSs) with a single-base precision.

This repository contains a set of bash, python and R scripts which were used for Topo-Seq data analysis and visualization. 
Raw sequencing data and some processed files (coverage depth WIG, N3E WIG, GCSs lists) can be retrieved from GEO datasets with accession GSE117186.

# Main pipeline

![alt text](https://github.com/sutormin94/Gyrase_Topo-seq/blob/master/Pipeline_overview/Main_pipeline.png)

## Raw_reads_processing.sh

Shell script that makes QC of the reads before and after the trimming procedure. 
Than script maps trimmed and paired reads to the reference genome, prepares sorted and 
indexed BAM-files suitable for visualization with IGV.

**Requirements:** factqc, trimmomatic, bwa mem, samtools, shell

**Input:** Raw reads files (FASTQ), Genome file (FASTA)

**Output:** FastQC reports, SAM files, sorted and indexed BAM files

######################

## SAM_to_coverage_and_N5E_N3E.py

Script takes SAM files as an input, performs QC filtering of reads relying on the alignment quality and a presence of the partner: 
only reads pairs that have a score<256 are stored. Than the script computes coverage depth for DNA chains separately and for both. 
Additionally it calculates N5E (number of DNA fragments starts) and N3E (number of DNA fragments ends) values for every genome position. 
Coverage depth, N3E and N5E info returns as WIG files.

**Requirements:** python 3

**Input:** SAM files, chromosome identificator (for output WIG)

**Output:** SAM files contain proper aligned reads only, TAB files with start coordinates of DNA fragments alignments and alignment lengths, a range of WIG files:
coverage depth for forward strand, reverse strand, and for both strands, N3E, N5E, and N3E+N5E data 

######################

## GCSs_calling.py

The script takes WIG files tetrade that contain N3E or N5E values: A+IP+, A+IP-, A-IP+, A-IP-. It smooths A+IP- and A-IP- tracks and 
divides A+IP+ and A-IP+ by them. Once A+IP+_div and A-IP+_div are obtained the script performs Audic-Clavery statistic test (Audic & Claverie, 1997) 
and returns regions of A+IP+_div where i and i+5 positions are significantly higher than corresponding in A-IP+. 
These regions from now are called GCSs. GCSs are stored in the output TXT file. Also two plots are generated: 1) 
signal coverage over the genome for treated and untreated samples; 2) Motif expected to be under the GCSs.

**Requirements:** python 3

**Input:** TAB file with deletions coordinates, N3E or N5E values containing WIG files forms a tetrade (A+IP+, A+IP-, A-IP+, A-IP-), FASTA genome file
